    <h2 id="overview">Identity Document - <strong>IdentityDoc</strong></h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="IDENTITY_DOC"><strong>IdentityDoc</strong></a> document is an optional 
        identity document that allows users to define ownership and include identifying markers 
        for a collection of documents. If used, the <a href="IDENTITY_DOC"><strong>IdentityDoc</strong></a> 
        document can be referenced by all other documents.

            The <a href="IDENTITY_DOC"><strong>IdentityDoc</strong></a> is a document of importance within 
            the Regno Standard. This document though optional can have its use mandated by organising 
            bodies to allow the body to identify the source owner of the document. It is intended that 
            organising bodies could create their own <a href="IDENTITY_DOC"><strong>IdentityDoc</strong></a> 
            document and then supply the generated <i>id</i> value to end users who would be mandated to 
            include the supplied <i>id</i> in each of the mandated documents.

            The <a href="IDENTITY_DOC"><strong>IdentityDoc</strong></a> document can also be used 
            internally within organisations as a high level method of data rights access. An example of such 
            use would be the creation of key/pair tag values that correspond with specific access rights. 
            The user API implementation would use these document rights to only allow access to a given set 
            of documents for a given set of users. Multiple <a href="IDENTITY_DOC"><strong>IdentityDoc</strong></a> 
            documents can be created and referenced by each of the other document 
            types to create a powerful hierarchal ownership and access rights tree.
