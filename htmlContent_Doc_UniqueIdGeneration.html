    <h2 id="overview">Documentation - Unique Id Generation</h2>
    <p>
        All documents conforming to the <strong>Regno Standard</strong> must be given a unique identifier at creation time.
        <br />
        <br />
        The allocation of a unique identifier per document allows for both document parenting, for example
        the <a href="CONFIG_DOC"><strong>ConfigDoc</strong></a> document and all associated child documents, and for the efficient
        reuse of documents, for example the <a href="PARAM_DEFINITION_DOC"><strong>ParamDefinitionDoc</strong></a> document.
        <br />
        <br />
        The recommended method for the generation of the unique identifier string is by the calculation of a
        hash of all fields and values (excluding the <i>id</i> field) that are contained in the document. For some
        documents, some fields are excluded from the hash generation to allow for the updating of document data
        without requiring a new document hash to be generated. These additional fields that are to be excluded in the
        hash generation are noted in the Description column text for each appropriate field.
        <br />
        <br />
        By employing a hash value as the document identifier, each time a new document is created, the new
        document can be checked to validate if the document already exists within the document store, and
        if so the existing document can be reused without any action, saving both storage and compute resource.
        <br />
        <br />
        Employing a hash as the unique identifier also enables data pools of documents to be merged and
        synchronised from different data sources and locations without risk of data corruption.
