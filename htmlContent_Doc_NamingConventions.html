    <h2 id="overview">Documentation - Naming Convention</h2>

    To ensure consistency in the naming of documents and document fields, the following
    naming convention is used by the <strong>Regno Standard</strong>.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Each document name will be a single string without any spacing. The first character will be
            uppercase with following characters following the Camel case convention.
            Examples include <a href="CONFIG_DOC"><strong>ConfigDoc</strong></a> and <a href="IDENTITY_DOC"><strong>IdentifyDoc</strong></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each field name will be a single string without any spacing. The first character
            will be lowercase with following characters following the Camel case convention.
            Examples include <i>axisValuesX</i> and <i>configDocId</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each document type field will be abbreviated where possible using the following:
            <ul>
                <li>The word “Configuration” becomes <strong>“Config”</strong></li>
                <li>The word “Parameter” becomes <strong>“Param”</strong></li>
                <li>The word “Conversion” becomes <strong>“Conv”</strong></li>
                <li>The word “Statistic” becomes <strong>“Stat”</strong></li>
                <li>The word “Definition” becomes <strong>“Def”</strong></li>
                <li>The word “Document” becomes <strong>“Doc”</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each document type field is post fixed with the string <strong>“Doc”</strong>.
            Examples include Config<strong>Doc</strong> and EventDef<strong>Doc</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            For all document fields excluding <i>type</i>, the following is used:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Any field that references another document shall contain the referenced document name 
                    as a postfix including the referenced field. An example 
                    field includes <i>paramDefDocId</i>, which is a field whose value is the <i>id</i>
                    field value of a <strong>ParamDefDoc</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any field that does not reference another document shall not be abbreviated. 
                    Examples include <i>documentInterval</i> and <i>linearRegressionSlope</i>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
