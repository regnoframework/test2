    <h2 id="overview">Documentation - Format Strings</h2>
    <p>
        For documents that contain a <i>format</i> field, a standardised string format is required to so
        that all <strong>Regno Standard</strong> documents maintain compatibility regardless of the language used to create the document.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the <strong>Regno Standard</strong>, the format specifier that has been selected is the C format specifier.
        <br />
        <br />
        By selecting the C format, the widest range of programming languages can be utilised for document processing 
        interfaces as many languages already have built in support for C format specifiers though the use of printf and its derivatives.
